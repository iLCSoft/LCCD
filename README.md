## Build instructions
In order to build LCCD you need LCIO, ILCUTIL, CMake and optionally CondDBMySQL

if you have access to /cvmfs/ilc.desy.de/ then you will find all this packages under:
```
/cvmfs/ilc.desy.de/sw/x86_64_gcc49_sl6/
```

if you do NOT have acces to /cvmfs/ilc.desy.de/ or you do not have an SL6 machine the easiest way is to use ilcinstall (http://ilcsoft.desy.de/portal/software_packages/ilcinstall/).

Once the dependencies are resolved, issue the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -C $ILCSOFT/ILCSoft.cmake ..
make install
make tests    # optional step to build LCCD tests
```

## Start test database

0. select the mysql version you want to use, e.g.
```
export PATH=/opt/products/mysql/5.0.26/bin:$PATH
```

1. create a data directory
```
mkdir /tmp/mysqlDB
```
2. init the database
```
mysql_install_db --datadir=/tmp/mysqlDB
```
3. start the database
```
mysqld_safe --datadir=/tmp/mysqlDB &
```
or:
```
mysqld_safe --datadir=/tmp/mysqlDB --socket=/tmp/mysql.sock --log-error=mysql.log --pid-file=mysql.pid  &
```
3. b. you can stop the database  - no need to do it now ]
```
mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown  
```
4. set root password (and remember it)
```
mysqladmin -u root password <mypassword>
```
5. create users for LCCD [NOTE: THIS IS FOR TESTING ONLY - BE CAREFUL WITH USER RIGHTS/PRIVILEGES !!!!!]
```
mysql -u root -p 
grant all privileges on *.* to calvin@localhost identified by 'hobbes' with grant option ;
grant all privileges on *.* to calvin@"%" identified by 'hobbes' with grant option ; 
quit
```

## Run examples
If you built against CondDBMysql and built the tests, you can run them as follows:
```
cd ../test
./createcalfile hcal.slcio hcal
./readcalfile hcal.slcio hcal

./calfiletodb hcal.slcio hcal myhcal 100 200
./calfiletodb hcal.slcio hcal myhcal 200 300
./calfiletodb hcal.slcio hcal myhcal 300 400
./calfiletodb hcal.slcio hcal myhcal 400 500

./tagdbfolder /lccd/myhcal mytag01 "just a test tag"

./calfiletodb hcal.slcio hcal myhcal 0 500

./calfilefromdb myhcal 120 fromdb.slcio mytag01

./calfilefromdb myhcal 20 fromdb.slcio 
```


It might be instructive to read the code in parallel and inspect the MySQL database, e.g. 
```
mysql -u calvin -p
```
Enter password:
